OPTIMIZATION
* We should be able to import abstract_model and helpers the same way.
* Decouple all components. For templates, use url names instead of actual urls.
* We need to make related changes (csrf enable, EmailBackend disable) and upgrade Django to latest version on both pay4me mall development and production.
* We might need to change payment app name.
* Fix page controls and searches.
* Learn how to use post_save(), it's useful when a user is created at the admin.
* Host on rackspace server with mod_wsgi.
* Use django redirects app.
* Use session_expiry.
* Use user.has_perms() or user.groups() to set backend staff permissions in ModelAdmin queryset().
* Do we need **kwargs in functions with h.json_response as helper?
* Calling a javascript function in form action. Is it not bad practice?
* Use model get_absolute_url() instead of explicitly-defined links in templates.
* As a temporary alternative to bulk products upload, we might use formsets to enable merchants upload more than one product at a time.
* Store Search.
* ShoppingCartForm isn't supposed to be in store/forms.py.
* Implement edit in shopping cart preview.
* Disable checkout link if there're no items in shopping cart.
* Use clearer urls. e.g. Instead of /departments/1/, use /departments/household-goods/
* Set last_modified column when product changes.
* Implement shopping cart history feature.
* I'm thinking Store model should be in mall/models.
* account_name usage in store url is OK for now, when we devise a better store url, e.g. http://amazemobiles.pay4memall.com/, we can start using slugs.
* Don't forget; we can pass some extra argument to a view through a urlpattern.
* Make ShoppingCartEditForm.quantity a select field based on stock amount.
* Validate account_name field to allow upper and lower cased alphabets, - and _.
* Fix NoReverseMatch error when url names are used.
* Implement SlugField in mall Category, store ProductGroup, Product and ProductDetail models.

FEATURES
* Unit Testing (models/views)**.


Before We Launch - Beta
=======================
BUGS
* Urls cleanup, Production payment response url should be /payment/response/.
* Use backend validation (strictly) for all form fields.
* Plugin email and sms functionality.
* Let's not use ajax for now.

- Remove "Save" bar and change "Change Order" to "View Order" on order change form.

URGENT
======
* User notification on add_to_cart().
* Email store_owner on completion of an order by buyer.
* Email delivery guys on completion of a transaction.
* Split registration form into sub-units e.g. Personal Details, Login Details, e.t.c.
* Bulk products upload.

FEATURES
* Include a cron job file that runs './manage.py update_index' periodically.
* Delivery to be handled by NIPOST, let's have email functionality for that, per transaction.
