* We should be able to import abstract_model and helpers the same way.
* Decouple all components. For templates, use url names instead of actual urls.
* We need to make related changes (csrf enable, EmailBackend disable) and upgrade Django to latest version on both pay4me mall development and production.
* We might need to change payment app name.
* Fix page controls and searches.
* Learn how to use post_save(), it's useful when a user is created at the admin.

BUGS
* Do we need **kwargs in functions with h.json_response as helper?
