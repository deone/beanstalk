* We need to build in an admin interface for merchants and disable the store model on django admin.
* Write tests! (Models and views).
* We should be able to import abstract_model and helpers the same way.
* Decouple all components.

BUGS
* User -> Store relationship should be OneToOne.
* Once a user is logged in, we can access their details from HttpRequest, so we don't need to pass user_id from template to view.
* Don't forget post_save signal when registering users.
* Do we need **kwargs in functions with h.json_response as helper?
