* We should be able to import abstract_model and helpers the same way.
* Decouple all components. For templates, use url names instead of actual urls.
* We need to make related changes (csrf enable, EmailBackend disable) and upgrade Django to latest version on both pay4me mall development and production.
* We might need to change payment app name.
* Fix page controls and searches.
* Learn how to use post_save(), it's useful when a user is created at the admin.
* Host on rackspace server with mod_wsgi.
* Use django redirects app.
* Use session_expiry.
* Use user.has_perms() to set backend staff permissions in ModelAdmin queryset().
* Do we need **kwargs in functions with h.json_response as helper?
* Calling a javascript function in form action. Is it not bad practice?

BUGS
* Use backend validation (strictly) for all forms.
