* We need to build in an admin interface for merchants and disable the store model on django admin.
* Write tests! (Models and views).
* Refactor and remove style redundancies. DRY!
* Find solution to forms replication in views using FormSet class.
* Create payment flow.
* We should be able to import abstract_model and helpers the same way.
* Decouple all components.

BUGS
* Fix ajax session shopping cart display issues.
* Session urls should be not contain session_id.
* mall/views display_cart should be show_cart_details.
* Use django's UserProfile technique to store additional information about users.
* User -> Store relationship should be OneToOne.
* Once a user is logged in, we can access their user details from HttpRequest, so we don't need to pass user_id from template to view.
* We should also be able to get at session_id from request instead of sending session_id from the template.
* Fix forms anomalies.
