* We need to build in an admin interface for merchants and disable the store model on django admin.
* Write tests! (Models and views).
* We should be able to import abstract_model and helpers the same way.
* Decouple all components.
* Decouple templates: Use url names instead of actual urls.
* We need to make related changes (csrf enable, EmailBackends disable) and upgrade Django to latest version on both pay4me mall development and production.

BUGS
* Don't forget post_save signal when registering users.
* Do we need **kwargs in functions with h.json_response as helper?
