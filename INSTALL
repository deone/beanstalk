How to use Django with Apache and mod_wsgi
==========================================
Deploying Django with Apache and mod_wsgi is the recommended way to get Django into production.

Basic Configuration
===================
Once youâ€™ve got mod_wsgi installed and activated, edit your httpd.conf file and add:

WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/mysite/apache/django.wsgi

The first bit above is the url you want to be serving your application at (/ indicates the root url), and the second is the location of a "WSGI file" -- see below -- on your system, usually inside of your project. This tells Apache to serve any request below the given URL using the WSGI application defined by that file.

Next we'll need to actually create this WSGI application, so create the file mentioned in the second part of WSGIScriptAlias and add:

import os
import sys

os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'mysite.settings'

import django.core.handlers.wsgi
application = django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler()

If your project is not on your PYTHONPATH by default you can add:

sys.path.append('/usr/local/django')

just above the final import line to place your project on the path. Remember to replace 'mysite.settings' with your correct settings file, and '/usr/local/django' with your own project's location.

Serving media files
===================
This example sets up Django at the site root, but explicitly serves robots.txt, favicon.ico, any CSS file, and anything in the /media/ URL space as a static file. All other URLs will be served using mod_wsgi:

Alias /robots.txt /usr/local/wsgi/static/robots.txt
Alias /favicon.ico /usr/local/wsgi/static/favicon.ico

AliasMatch /([^/]*\.css) /usr/local/wsgi/static/styles/$1

Alias /media/ /usr/local/wsgi/static/media/

<Directory /usr/local/wsgi/static>
Order deny,allow
Allow from all
</Directory>

WSGIScriptAlias / /usr/local/wsgi/scripts/django.wsgi

<Directory /usr/local/wsgi/scripts>
Order allow,deny
Allow from all
</Directory>
